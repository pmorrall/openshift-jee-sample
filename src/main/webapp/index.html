				What can we do for your Business
			</h2>
			<p class="thb-sectionDesc">
			The Hyper Block started as the demand for decentralized applications using Blockchain technology increases. Lets do away with the middleman. Decentralize your Business Process and logic. A blockchain network is a decentralized system for the efficient and secure exchange of business assets. Enter Hyperledger this shared, distributed ledger records an immutable history of asset transactions between members of the network, and catalogs the current state of those assets. Smart contracts, also known as chaincode ensure that the business rules that govern transactions are encoded, and the Business logic can run seamlessly through the network. Consensus Lets do away with the middleman Why relying on a central authority or trusted intermediary, such as a bank or brokerage firm, to validate transactions. The consensus mechanism is the ensuring trust, accountability, and transparency across the network. Add channels For additional confidentiality, members join one or more channels that allow for data isolation; a channel-specific ledger is shared across the authenticated peers in that channel. A blockchain network is collectively owned and operated by a group of identifiable and verifiable institutions, such as a business or university, for example. It's a permissioned network, where the participants are known to each other. The Hyper Block Team can help you to develope your client applications to streamline all the Business process and logic. With the use of HyperLedger Fabric and the understanding of the Business Process we can link the two together, no more individual company asset controls and accounts, saving you time and money.</p>

				What Does Blockchain Solve?
			</h2>
			<p class="thb-sectionDesc">We're all familiar with digital artifacts and the ease with which they can be copied. These present obvious problems when one considers using such things to represent assets such as money. What prevents someone from making copies and spending the same money twice? Traditionally, this is resolved by using a third party as a trusted ledger keeper. Examples include banks, charge card companies and payment services. They all keep digital ledgers to address the double-spending problem. 
Consequently, it is not generally possible for two parties to exchange value online without also involving a trusted third party with the settlement process. That is, it wasn't possible before Bitcoin demonstrated a new method of addressing the double-spending problem. 
At a high level, Bitcoin solves the problem by replacing the trusted central ledger-keeper with a network of ledger-keepers. They each have a replica of the ledger and they use this to observe proposed changes and reach consensus about new ledger states. No one can make a change to the ledger without first achieving network consensus about the change. It's as though each transaction is observed by a large crowd of witnesses who form a consensus of everything that has occurred and even prohibit events that should not occur. Events that should not occur include spending non-existent funds and double-spending. 
Bitcoin convincingly demonstrates that a network of nodes that don't necessarily trust each other can form a consensus about transaction validation, transaction history and the resulting state. This is interesting because simple ledgers of account balances and a simple protocol for moving funds is far from the only use-case for shared consensus about data.

				How Does it Work
			</h2>
			<p class="thb-sectionDesc">Imagine one wants to retain and monitor changes to a file, for example a logfile. Further, imagine one wants to verify an unbroken history of all changes ever made to the file. How can one proceed? 
A well-understood solution uses cryptographic hash functions. Let us briefly introduce the concept in case you are unfamiliar with it. 
The ideal cryptographic hash function has five main properties:<br>
	It is deterministic so the same message always results in the same hash <br>
	It is quick to compute the hash value for any given message <br>
	It is infeasible to generate a message from its hash value except by trying all possible messages <br>
	A small change to a message should change the hash value so extensively that the new hash value appears uncorrelated with the old hash value <br>
	It is infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash value <br>
You can see hashing in action to get the feel for it here: <a href="http://onlinemd5.com/" target="_blank">Onlinemd5</a>. Notice that there are different hashing algorithms that aim for similar results as described above. Also notice that as you type in the text box the hash updates and even a miniscule change to the input creates a completely different hash. Finally, notice that each algorithm consistently produces hashes of the same size regardless of the size of the input. 
A hash can be used to prove an input exactly matches the original, but the original cannot be reconstructed from a hash. 
We can start with the first version of a file and record a hash of the file contents. 
What about subsequent changes to the file? Let's suppose that we will only append new entries to the end of the file. 
We can make a rule that states that in addition to the new content, the previous hash will also be an input to the next hash. That is (pseudocode), <br>
version2Hash = hash(version2Changes + version1Hash)<br>
This way, one can examine candidate changes and confirm that the previous file is correct, and the subsequent changes are accurately disclosed. This process repeats for all subsequent versions. Any version of the file contents can be shown to be part of an unbroken chain of changes all the way back to the file inception. This is pure mathematics. Any departure from the system, e.g. a hash does not compute as expected, proves a break in the history and is therefore invalid. 
Interestingly, since knowledge of the current hash of the latest valid version is an input to the next version's hash function, it is not possible to generate a new valid version without knowledge of the valid version that precedes it. This process forces changes to be appended to a previous valid version. 
Blockchain functions in a similar manner. Blocks of transactions are appended using hashes of previous blocks as inputs into hashes of subsequent blocks. Any participant can quickly verify an unbroken chain of blocks (in the correct order). 
Transaction blocks are logical units that wrap up a set of transactions in a specific order. While the implementation details are somewhat more subtle, for now, let's think of this as the set of transactions that occurred during a time interval, in a specific order. 
Transaction ordering is surprisingly challenging in a blockchain system due to design goals and constraints. We'll use the example of Bitcoin and its novel solution to understand the issues and how this can be addressed.<br> 
	As a distributed network, everyone has a little bit of authority. For example, all nodes can generate transactions and then announce that information to other nodes. <br>
	In a truly distributed network, no one's clock is considered more authoritative than anyone else's clock. Therefore, we need a solution that doesn't involve timestamps or network time. <br>
	Anyone can, theoretically, listen to transaction proposals and organize a valid block containing an opinion about the correct order of events. <br>
	Because of physics and network latency, everyone on the network will learn about transaction proposals in a slightly different order. How then can the correct order of transactions be determined? <br>
Even if we assume that all members of the network mean well and participate honestly, they will surely arrive at somewhat different opinions about the correct ordering of transactions and there is no obvious way to settle the matter. Transaction order must be resolved because processing transactions out of order produces non-trivial differences in outcomes. Without agreement about transaction order, there can be no agreement about results. 
Bitcoin uses a process called Proof-of-Work which can be (simplistically) thought of as a lottery. The lucky winner wins the privilege of being authoritative for one block of transactions. The winning lottery ticket, called the nonce, is used as another input for the hash function. This is easily verified by other participants. The lottery winner's opinion about the order of transactions within the block becomes the network's de facto official result. 
In case the foregoing isn't clear: A valid block is a well ordered set of transactions, contains the hash of the previous block, and contains a "winning lottery ticket" (nonce). Other participants recognize this unlikely combination (unlikely because of the winning lottery ticket) and accept the block as a de facto correct opinion about the order of transactions. This process disambiguates the order of the transactions even though well-meaning nodes independently arrive at slightly different opinions about the matter. The process does so without reliance on an authoritative time source. 
A well ordered set of blocks of well-ordered transactions is a well-ordered set of all transactions. 
Cryptographic hash functions are instrumental in that they empower all participants to satisfy themselves that they possess an undistorted history of everything. Since all nodes can verify the chain independently, they can proceed on the assumption that all other nodes will eventually come into agreement about the history of everything. This is known as eventual consensus. 
A blockchain starts with a known state. This is a simple matter of an initialized universe in which nothing has happened. A blockchain proceeds by constructing a verifiable and widely agreed history of everything that has ever happened. Nodes independently construct a present state of the universe by reviewing the ordered history of every change (the transactions) that has ever occurred. The history of everything that has ever occurred moves forward in time as "lottery winners" announce new transaction blocks and these are accepted as valid by a consensus of network participants.

				Introduction to Bitcoin
			</h2>
			<p class="thb-sectionDesc">Since 2009 the most successful and popular public blockchain network has been Bitcoin. Bitcoin was first introduced with the publication of the original paper Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system (2008) by Satoshi Nakamoto. In this paper, Nakamoto describes Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash. He suggest that proof-of-work can be used to find the truth in a partially synchronous system without involving trusted parties. Using this method, the set of participants controlling the majority of the computing power determines the truth.
Let us look at this in more detail. Nakamoto does not use the term block chain in his paper, but he describes the concept by explaining transactions in Bitcoin. The transaction process requires the signing of the transaction with the hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the receiver. This is called the chain of ownership. Transactions can contain several inputs and outputs.
</p>
			<h2 class="thb-sectionHeading">
				<span class="thb-subHeading"></span>
				Introduction to Ethereum
			</h2>
			<p class="thb-sectionDesc">Ethereum emerged from a range of proposals rejected by the Bitcoin community. The most important difference, as compared to Bitcoin, is the implementation of distributed code execution through the Ethereum Virtual Machine. This code execution platform is Turing-complete. The EVM enables the deployment of so-called smart contracts via transactions.
Ethereum has a much faster block time than Bitcoin (currently around 15s), made practical thanks to its implementation of the GHOST protocol.[1] Ethereum implements a variation of Bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus algorithm called Ethash, which is intended to be ASIC-resistant and GPU friendly[2]. Core developers of the Ethereum project are planning to propose switching to the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm in the future. 
Let us have a look at the Ethereum protocol to understand how it differs from Bitcoin. Our reference is the yellow paper Ethereum: A Secure Decentralised Generalised Transaction Ledger (2014) by Dr. Gavin Wood.
The Ethereum network is a virtual state machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The implementation of such a state machine with blockchain is revolutionary in itself. To achieve Turing-completeness frameworks must overcome the "halting problem" which is difficult, especially in a distributed, hierarchy-free computing platform. In case this isn't clear, the halting problem is about what to do in the case that a process runs amok. Well-known solutions such as a hardware reset don't apply to a worldwide state machine that can't be restarted.
Ethereum's solution is to introduce "gas" as a fee for each computational step. Every block has a maximum gas limit. This limits the number of computational steps that can be executed per block. When paid for, gas is given a price. Individual users control this price at the transaction level, and are free to specify any gasPrice. That is, users bid for network computation. When the accounting is done, the EVM converts this transaction gasPrice and gas consumed into Ether spent. Ether is the native Ethereum currency, which is issued via the mining process. The Ethereum protocol defines the gas cost for each operation in the EVM.
A smart contract in the EVM is practically an autonomous agent with an internal account. While external actors, e.g. human, sign transactions, contracts execute deterministic code. They have no alternative. Correct execution of smart contract code is part of the transaction validation process. The most popular high-level language for writing such a contract is Solidity.
